## Problem Statement
- Lots of people migartes to new cities to make there professional and educational career and want to have residence not far away from there workplace and college.This Model will help them to figured out rent based on Locality they wants to acquire,model includes major cities like Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Bangalore.

- When i was on college i have also faced this issue while hunting residence and due to lack of information of that particular area resulted me to pay ₹ 1500 extra for the property which we have acquired for rent.

## Project Overview
